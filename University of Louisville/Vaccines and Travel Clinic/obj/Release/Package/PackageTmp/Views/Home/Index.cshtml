                    <dd>
                        You can initialize ASP.NET Identity when the application starts. Since ASP.NET Identity is Entity Framework based in this sample,
                        you can create DatabaseInitializer which is configured to get called each time the app starts.
                        <strong>Please look in App_Start\IdentityConfig.cs</strong>
                        This code shows the following

                        When you create a User using a username or password, the Identity system performs validation on the username and password, and the passwords are hashed before they are
                        stored in the database. You can customize the validation by changing some of the properties of the validators such as Turn alphanumeric on/off, set minimum password length
                        or you can write your own custom validators and register them with the UserManager.

                        This sample shows how you can use Two-Factor authentication. This sample has a SMS and email service registered where you can send SMS or email for sending the security code.
                        You can add more two-factor authentication factors such as QR codes and plug them into ASP.NET Identity.

                                When you logout and login, after you enter the username and password, you will get an option of how to get the security code to use for two-factor authentication.

                                The sample also shows how to protect against Brute force attacks against two-factor codes. When you enter a code incorrectly for 5 times then you will be
                                lockedout for 5 min before you can enter a new code. These settings can be configured in App_Start\IdentityConfig.cs by setting  DefaultAccountLockoutTimeSpan and MaxFailedAccessAttemptsBeforeLockout on the UserManager.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                If the machine you are browsing this website is your own machine, you can choose to check the "Remember Me" option after you enter the code.
                                This option will remember you forever on this machine and will not ask you for the two-factor authentication, the next time when you login to the website.
                                You can change your "Remember Me" settings for two-factor authentication in the Manage page.

                        Support a way to regenerate the Security Token for the user in cases when the User changes there password or any other security related information such as removing an associated login(such as Facebook, Google, Microsoft Account etc).
                        This is needed to ensure that any tokens generated with the old password are invalidated. In the sample project, if you change the users password then a new token is generated for the user and any previous tokens are invalidated.
                        This feature provides an extra layer of security to your application since when you change your password, you will be logged out from everywhere (all other browsers) where you have logged into this application.

                        You can extend ASP.NET Identity to write your own custom storage provider for storing the ASP.NET Identity system and user data
                        in a persistance system of your choice such as MondoDb, RavenDb, Azure Table Storage etc.
